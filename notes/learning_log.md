## 🗓️ June 9, 2025 – Completed My First ML Project

### ✅ Project: Housing Price Predictor (Linear Regression)
- Loaded and explored the **California Housing Dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`.
- Performed **EDA (exploratory data analysis)**:
  - Descriptive statistics
  - Correlation matrix
  - Scatter plots
- Built a **Linear Regression** model using `scikit-learn`.
- Evaluated model using **RMSE** (~0.75).
- Visualized results:
  - **Predicted vs Actual** plot
  - **Correlation matrix heatmap**
- Learned to:
  - Structure a Jupyter Notebook
  - Save work in Google Colab
  - Push code and results to **GitHub**
  - Add a **README.md** and embed images
  - Add a **Colab launch button**
